                <h3 class="step-header">Step 1</h3>
                <p class="step-description">Pour warm water into the bowl of stand mixer; mix in yeast and sugar and let dissolve. Add 2 teaspoons olive oil, salt, and bread flour. Knead mixture together with a dough hook attachment until dough is very smooth, soft, and elastic.</p>

                <h3 class="step-header">Step 2</h3>
                <p class="step-description">Drizzle remaining olive oil over the bottom of a 10x14-inch Detroit-style pizza pan and spread around with your fingers. Place dough in the center; pull and stretch into a roughly rectangular shape with oiled fingers. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Prepare sauce and cheese in the meantime.</p>

                <h3 class="step-header">Step 6</h3>
                <p class="step-description">Rub fingertips with some olive oil from the pan. Press out air from the dough while stretching and pushing into a rectangle that goes all the way to the edges of the pan. Stretch up the sides about 1/2 inch or so.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="step-box">
                <h3 class="step-header">Step 7</h3>
